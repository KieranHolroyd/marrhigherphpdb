You will find the meekrodb class file in the pupil shared area in the directory on the whiteboard.
Copy it into your web directory on the wamp server and add this code into a file called 'displayresults.php'

<?php include 'meekrodb.2.3.class.php';

DB::$host       = 'marr-wamp';
DB::$user       = 'YOURUSER';
DB::$password   = 'YOURPASSWORD';
DB::$dbName     = 'higher_readingdb';

$result = DB::query("SELECT * FROM displayresults ORDER BY id DESC");
$result_tree = array();

foreach ($result as $result) {
  $result_tree[$result['r1']][]=$result;
}
?>

You will then need to add in 2 foreach statements

<?php foreach ($result_tree as $result_group => $result_list) { ?>
<?php foreach ($result_list as $result) { ?>
